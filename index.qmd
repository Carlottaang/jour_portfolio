Hi! My name is Carlotta Angiolillo, and I’m a junior at Northwestern University studying journalism and data science. I’m currently reporting on health and science as a Congressional reporter in Washington, D.C. through Northwestern’s Medill on the Hill program.

At Northwestern, I’ve spent countless hours working as a reporter and editor for The Daily Northwestern. Being a member of The Daily has allowed me to become a well-rounded journalist: audio, data, audience engagement and breaking news are some of the skills I’ve developed in my time on staff.

I’ve also freelanced for WBEZ and interned with the Houston Chronicle’s Pulitzer Prize-winning opinion team. Those experiences have strengthened my reporting and editing skills while deepening my commitment to journalism that elevates underrepresented voices and perspectives.

Outside of journalism, I’m usually at a local coffee shop, learning new guitar chords or catching up on the latest episode of Abbott Elementary.

You can reach me at carlottaangiolillo2027@u.northwestern.edu or 832-728-7576.
