Hi! My name is Carlotta Angiolillo, and I'm a junior at Northwestern University studying journalism and data science. I'm currently working as a Congressional reporter covering health and science in Washington, D.C. through Northwestern's Medill on the Hill program.

At Northwestern, I've spent countless hours working as a reporter and editor for The Daily Northwestern. Being a member of The Daily has allowed me to become a well-rounded journalist: audio, data, audience engagement and breaking news are some of the skills I've developed in my time on staff.

As a college student, I've also had the opportunity to work with journalists at WBEZ as a freelancer. Last summer, I was an intern for the Houston Chronicle's Pulitzer Prize-winning opinion team. Both of these experiences strengthened my commitment to a career in journalism and my desire to uplift the voices of people who are often ignored or underrepresented in media.

Outside of journalism, you can usually find me at a local coffee shop, learning new chords on the guitar or watching the latest episode of Abbott Elementary.

You can reach me at carlottaangiolillo2027\@u.northwestern.edu or 832-728-7576.
